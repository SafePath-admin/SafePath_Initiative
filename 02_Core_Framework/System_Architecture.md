# System Architecture — SafePath Core Framework

## Purpose

This document defines the high-level system architecture of the SafePath Initiative.
It explains how core components relate to one another without prescribing clinical workflows,
technologies, or partner-specific implementations.

---

## Architectural Overview

SafePath is organized as a layered system composed of:

1. **Core Framework (PDSP)**
2. **Delivery & Support Structures**
3. **Adjunct Tools and Technologies**
4. **Partner and Community Programs**

Each layer is independent yet interoperable.

---

## Layer 1 — Core Framework (PDSP)

The Psychological Decompression & Stabilization Protocols (PDSP) form the non-negotiable core.

- PDSP defines *what* SafePath is
- PDSP does not define *how* it must be delivered
- PDSP remains device-agnostic and context-flexible

All SafePath-aligned activity must conform to PDSP principles and structure.

---

## Layer 2 — Delivery & Support Structures

Delivery structures enable PDSP application within real-world environments.

Examples include:
- Peer support networks
- Responder advocate models
- Clinical alignment pathways
- Community-based support systems

These structures adapt PDSP to local realities without altering the framework itself.

---

## Layer 3 — Adjunct Tools and Technologies

Adjuncts may support PDSP delivery but are not structural components.

Examples include:
- Digital platforms
- Devices
- Applications
- Media or educational tools

Adjuncts are optional and interchangeable.
Their presence or absence does not redefine PDSP.

---

## Layer 4 — Partner & Community Programs

External organizations may create programs aligned with SafePath.

- Programs must operate *within* PDSP
- Programs do not redefine PDSP
- Multiple programs may coexist simultaneously

This enables federation without fragmentation.

---

## Design Principles

- **Separation of Framework and Delivery**
- **Non-Dependence on Technology**
- **Scalability Across Contexts**
- **Governed Expansion Without Centralization**

---

## Canonical Status

This document defines the authoritative architectural model of SafePath.

Lower-level documents may elaborate on implementation,
but may not alter this structure without formal governance action.
