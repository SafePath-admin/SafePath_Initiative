# PDSP — Psychological Decompression & Stabilization Protocols

## Overview

The Psychological Decompression & Stabilization Protocols (PDSP) constitute the core framework of the SafePath Initiative.

PDSP is a unified, device-agnostic system designed to support psychological decompression and stabilization across responder and civilian populations following exposure to traumatic stress.

---

## Framework Structure

PDSP consists of three primary sub-protocols, each aligned to context and severity:

### CEDSP  
**Critical Event Decompression & Stabilization Protocol**

Applies to acute, high-impact events requiring immediate or near-immediate psychological decompression following exposure.

---

### CIDSP  
**Critical Incident Decompression & Stabilization Protocol**

Applies to cumulative or significant incidents that may not require immediate intervention but demand structured decompression to prevent long-term harm.

---

### CDSP  
**Community Decompression & Stabilization Protocol**

Applies to civilian and community populations, adapting PDSP principles beyond responder systems.

---

## Design Principles

- **Unified Framework**  
  PDSP replaces fragmented or ad-hoc decompression models with a single, coherent structure.

- **Device-Agnostic**  
  PDSP does not depend on any specific device, platform, or delivery mechanism.

- **Scalable Application**  
  The framework applies across emergency services, allied professions, and civilian communities.

## Adjunct Components

Certain tools or technologies may be used in conjunction with PDSP.

These adjuncts are **optional** and **non-structural**.

Their use does not redefine or bridge PDSP tiers.

## Canonical Status

This document defines the authoritative baseline structure of PDSP.

Subsequent documents may expand on workflows, delivery mechanisms, or applications, but may not alter the core framework without formal governance action.
