# Framework Principles — SafePath Initiative

## Purpose

This document defines the governing principles of the SafePath Initiative.
These principles constrain all current and future implementations, partnerships,
technologies, and programs operating under the SafePath name.

They are non-negotiable unless formally amended through governance action.

---

## Principle 1 — Responder-Centered Origin

SafePath is built by responders, for responders.

All framework decisions must:
- Respect responder culture
- Preserve dignity and autonomy
- Avoid punitive, extractive, or surveillance-based approaches

---

## Principle 2 — Psychological Safety Before Performance

SafePath prioritizes psychological stabilization over productivity, optics, or metrics.

No component of SafePath may:
- Be used for discipline or evaluation
- Be tied to employment consequences
- Be weaponized against those seeking help

---

## Principle 3 — Framework Before Technology

Technology serves the framework — never the reverse.

- SafePath is not a device, app, or platform
- Tools may change without redefining the system
- No single technology may become structurally mandatory

---

## Principle 4 — Federated, Not Centralized

SafePath enables multiple aligned programs to coexist.

- Partners operate within the framework
- No partner owns the framework
- Local adaptation is encouraged within defined bounds

This prevents monopolization while preserving coherence.

---

## Principle 5 — Accessibility Across Contexts

SafePath must remain applicable across:
- Emergency services
- Allied professions
- Civilian and community settings

Exclusivity based on role, status, or geography is incompatible with the framework.

---

## Principle 6 — Protection of the Individual

Participation in SafePath must not increase risk to:
- Career
- Reputation
- Licensure
- Legal standing

Privacy, anonymity, and peer protections are core considerations in all implementations.

---

## Canonical Status

These principles govern all SafePath-aligned activity.

Future documents may elaborate on application,
but may not contradict or bypass these principles without formal governance amendment.
