# The Promotion Rule  
## SafePath Initiative

This document defines when material may be promoted from discussion or working storage into the canonical GitHub repository for the SafePath Initiative.

Its purpose is to preserve clarity, protect intellectual property, and maintain long-term continuity.

---

## Core Principle

**GitHub contains finalized truth only.**

Chats are for thinking.  
Dropbox is for working.  
GitHub is for record.

No material becomes canonical by accident.

---

## Eligible for Promotion

Material may be promoted to GitHub only when **all** of the following are true:

1. **Conceptually Stable**  
   The idea, definition, or document is no longer exploratory or actively changing in meaning.

2. **Reviewed in Context**  
   The content has been discussed within the appropriate SafePath chat domain and aligns with existing terminology and structure.

3. **Intentionally Approved**  
   A conscious decision has been made to preserve this content as authoritative.

4. **Non-Redundant**  
   The content does not duplicate existing canonical material and clearly belongs in a specific GitHub directory.

---

## Not Eligible for Promotion

The following must **never** be promoted directly to GitHub:

- Raw brainstorming or drafts
- Personal notes or reflections (unless explicitly designated as legacy content)
- Unreviewed legal documents
- Preliminary partner discussions
- Experimental language or branding concepts

These belong in chats or Dropbox.

---

## Promotion Process

All promotions follow this sequence:

1. **Chat → Decision**  
   The content is finalized or locked within the appropriate ChatGPT workspace.

2. **Dropbox → Working Artifact (Optional)**  
   Drafts, formatting, or supporting materials may be refined in Dropbox.

3. **GitHub → Canonical Record**  
   A clean, intentional markdown file is created or updated in GitHub.

4. **Progress Log Entry**  
   The promotion is recorded in the Master Progress Log with a timestamp and brief description.

---

## Authority & Amendments

This rule governs all SafePath Initiative repositories unless explicitly superseded.

Amendments to this rule must themselves follow the Promotion Rule.
