# Governance Overview — SafePath Initiative

## Purpose

This document defines the high-level governance posture of the SafePath Initiative.
It establishes intent, boundaries, and structural protections without serving as legal advice or contractual language.

Detailed legal instruments are developed separately and referenced as needed.

---

## Governance Intent

SafePath exists to preserve responder wellbeing, dignity, and life.

All governance decisions must:
- Protect the integrity of the framework
- Prevent misuse or coercive application
- Preserve trust among responders and communities

Governance serves the mission — not the reverse.

---

## Framework Ownership

The SafePath Initiative owns the core framework, terminology, and architectural structure.

- The framework is not open for unilateral modification
- Alignment does not confer ownership
- Use of the framework requires adherence to its principles

This prevents dilution while enabling collaboration.

---

## Partner Participation

External organizations may participate in SafePath through aligned programs.

- Partners operate **within** the framework
- Partners do not redefine the framework
- Multiple partners may coexist simultaneously

Participation may be governed by agreements appropriate to context.

---

## Intellectual Property Posture

SafePath’s intellectual property exists to:
- Preserve integrity
- Prevent harmful alteration
- Support sustainability of the initiative

IP protections are not intended to restrict good-faith use aligned with the mission.

---

## Legal Alignment

SafePath governance seeks alignment with:
- Peer support protections
- Anonymity safeguards
- Responder mental health statutes
- Applicable state and federal frameworks

Specific statutes and protections are documented separately.

---

## Canonical Status

This document defines the governing posture of the SafePath Initiative.

Future legal instruments, policies, or agreements must align with this posture unless formally amended through governance action.
