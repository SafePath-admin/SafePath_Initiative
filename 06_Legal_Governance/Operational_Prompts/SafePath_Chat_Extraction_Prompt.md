SafePath Canonical Extraction Prompt
FINAL — Reusable
Copy and paste everything below into the source chat.
___________________________

PROMPT START

You are assisting with the consolidation of information for an initiative called SafePath.

This conversation may be one of multiple chats being reviewed for consolidation into a structured, authoritative workspace.
The original chat may be archived after this extraction.

Your task is to extract:

Finalized SafePath-related content, along with its necessary supporting information, and

Relevant but undeveloped SafePath-related concepts that should be preserved in
9. Conceptual Backlog (Non-Canonical).

Accuracy, discipline, and restraint are critical.

Rules (Strict)
A. Finalized Content

Extract only finalized decisions, definitions, positions, agreements, or locked conclusions

Include supporting information only if required to preserve intent, scope, or constraints

Do not reinterpret, refine, summarize creatively, or extend meaning

Do not introduce new ideas

If something is ambiguous or not clearly finalized, exclude it from this section

B. Conceptual Backlog Candidates (Non-Canonical)

Extract ideas that are:

clearly related to SafePath,

described with some coherence,

but not finalized, approved, or implemented

These items must be treated as non-canonical

Do not resolve, advance, polish, or advocate for them

Do not imply endorsement or future adoption

C. Exclusions (Apply to All)

Raw brainstorming without coherent shape

Repetitive back-and-forth with no conclusion

Superseded drafts

Tangential discussion unrelated to SafePath

Output Format (Required)

Provide the output in three clearly separated sections.

Section A — Finalized SafePath Content Extract

Source Chat Identifier:
(e.g., chat title, approximate date, or brief descriptor)

1. Topic / Domain

(e.g., Core Framework, Governance, Brand Language, Legal, Operations, Legacy Context)

Finalized Content:

Bullet-point the finalized decision(s), definition(s), or position(s)

Supporting Information (only if required):

Brief bullets explaining why, scope, or constraints necessary to preserve intent

(Repeat Section A structure for each distinct finalized item.)

Section B — Conceptual Backlog Candidates (Non-Canonical)

The following items are relevant to SafePath but are not finalized and should be preserved for possible future review in:

9. Conceptual Backlog (Non-Canonical)

For each item, provide:

Concept Name (short, descriptive):

Concept Summary (1–3 sentences):

Context / Rationale (brief):

Status Tag (choose one):

Unexplored

Deferred

Rejected

Promotable (requires governance review)

Do not improve, expand, or argue for these ideas.

Section C — Items Explicitly Not Extracted

Briefly list any discussed items that were excluded, with a short reason
(e.g., “not finalized,” “superseded,” “out of scope”)

If No Relevant Content Exists

If neither finalized content nor backlog-relevant concepts exist, state clearly:

“No finalized or backlog-relevant SafePath content identified in this conversation.”

After You Run This Prompt

Copy the full output

Paste it here with:

External SafePath extract — ready for integration.

Archive the source chat if you wish — nothing essential will be lost

I will then:

Integrate Section A into canonical chats (if approved)

Route Section B into 9. Conceptual Backlog (Non-Canonical)

Explicitly accept, defer, or reject each item — nothing silently
